# Number Chunker

## Summary
- This project was created due to a conversation about memory training with a friend.
- In a research study which I cannot currently recall, a test subject was brought in to memorize numbers.The researchers found that the most effective way to increase the subjects capabilities was to practice grouping, or "**chunking**" the numbers (ex. 452135768 > 452 452 768) in to more easily memorable groups.
- This project is meant to simulate the conditions of the study to encourage cognitive training, and may be of interest to other people who would like to train their working memory.
